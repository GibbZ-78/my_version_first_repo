# my_version_first_repo

Hi there!

From January to July 2022, I'll be attending the 24-week bootcamp offered by The Hacking Project (aka THP - https://www.thehackingproject.org/) to update my (web) development skills, hence easing the prototyping of the platform and coding of the related smart concierge bot I wanna attach to it !  

This remote repo is my first true attempt on Git & Github as, when I learnt code, decades ago, such approaches were not really existing (in fact, Internet adn the Web were teens at the time ðŸ˜„)

Have a nice day, wanderer!
